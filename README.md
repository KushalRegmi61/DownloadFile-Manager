# Downloads Organizer
The **Downloads Organizer** is a Python-based automation tool that keeps your Downloads folder neat and organized. By categorizing files into subfolders (e.g., PDFs, Images, Videos, Documents, etc.) and automating the sorting process in real-time, this script saves time and eliminates clutter.

Powered by the `watchdog` library, the Downloads Organizer monitors your Downloads folder and sorts new files automatically, ensuring everything is always in the right place.

- **Error Handling**: Logs errors for any failed file movements.

To customize file categories, edit the `CATEGORIES` dictionary in the script:

```python
CATEGORIES = {
    "PDFs": [".pdf"],
    "Images": [".jpg", ".jpeg", ".png", ".gif"],
    "Videos": [".mp4", ".mkv", ".mov"],
    "Documents": [".docx", ".txt", ".xlsx"],
    "Executables": [".exe", ".msi", ".dmg"],
    "Others": []
}
```
